# ML_FRI_Dorian

This is my github page for my ML FRI assignments.

We went through a lot of ML algorithms, that we made from scratch. I tried to optimize with parallel computing, GPU computing. 

My favorite assignment (Week 7-8) was making a CNN from scratch using Pytorch to classify Fashion-MNIST.
